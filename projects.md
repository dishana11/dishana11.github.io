          <strong><a href="https://github.com/dishana11/Marvin" target="_blank">Marvin (Autonomous Indoor Robot)</a></strong><br>
          Designed and built an autonomous robot during YTS at Plaksha University. Marvin uses a LiDAR sensor, ultrasonic sensors, and a Raspberry Pi to map and navigate indoor spaces, detect obstacles and people, and carry items. The project included hardware assembly, Python firmware, and hands-on robotics teamwork.

          <strong><a href="https://github.com/dishana11/Cmd_Termux-Integration" target="_blank">CMD Error Detector & Fixer</a></strong><br>
          Developed a CLI tool to automatically detect common Windows CMD errors, explain them, and offer one-click fixes. Won 2nd place and a cash prize in a competitive hackathon.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong><a href="https://github.com/dishana11/PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGES_PREDICTOR" target="_blank">Programming Languages Predictor</a></strong><br>
          Created a Python-based tool that predicts which programming language a code snippet is written in. Utilizes various ML models for accurate language detection.

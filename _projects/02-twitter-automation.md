---

A bot designed for automating posts and interactions on X (formerly Twitter) for content scheduling and engagement.

The bot works on GitHub Actions with two workflows:
1.  **Manual Posting:** You can write a prompt and the bot will post it to your Twitter account.
2.  **Scheduled Posts:** Posts are automatically run according to the cron setup.

The project boasts 100% accuracy. The initial word limit is set to 280 characters, which is suitable for accounts without a premium plan. You can edit the prompt for scheduled posts by navigating to the `scheduled.py` file in the GitHub repository.

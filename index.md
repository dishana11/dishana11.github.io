        Hi! My name is Dishana. I recently completed high school and was a fully funded YTS scholar at Plaksha University, where I co-built “Marvin,” an autonomous indoor robot. I’ve published a research paper on Quantum Temporal Lattice theory and worked on applied AI projects, including NLP bots and CLI tools. I’ve also freelanced in AI automation and received a 90% scholarship at FIITJEE for academic excellence.

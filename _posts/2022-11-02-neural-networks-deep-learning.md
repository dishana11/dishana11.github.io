# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has grown rapidly in recent years, and at the heart of many of its breakthroughs lies **Deep Learning** — a subfield that allows computers to learn complex patterns from data.  
Deep Learning is built upon the concept of **Neural Networks**, computational systems inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.  

From voice assistants like Siri and Alexa to image recognition in self-driving cars, neural networks have transformed how machines perceive, understand, and interact with the world.

## What Are Neural Networks?

A **Neural Network** is a series of algorithms designed to recognize relationships in data. It mimics how neurons in our brain send signals to one another.

At its simplest, a neural network consists of three main layers:

1. **Input Layer** – Takes in the data (for example, pixel values of an image or words in a sentence).  
2. **Hidden Layers** – Process the data through weighted connections.  
3. **Output Layer** – Produces the final result (for example, classifying an image as a cat or dog).

Each layer is made up of **nodes (neurons)**, and each connection between nodes has an **associated weight** that determines how much influence one neuron has on another.

## The Biological Inspiration

The inspiration for neural networks came from neuroscience.  
In the human brain, billions of neurons transmit information through electrical signals.  
Similarly, in an artificial neural network (ANN), each neuron receives inputs, processes them, and passes them on.

While the resemblance is only partial, this biological analogy provides the foundation for understanding how machines can **“learn”** through **experience** — that is, through exposure to data.

## How a Neural Network Learns

Learning in a neural network happens through **training**, a process that adjusts the weights
